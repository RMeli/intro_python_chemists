# Contributing to 'An Introduction to Python for Chemists'

Welcome! We're excited about your interest in contributing to this resources, which we will refer to in this document as `intro_python_chemist` as that is the name of the [Github Repo](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/intro_python_chemists/). 

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved.
If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/intro_python_chemists/issues)!

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

## Joining the conversation

This is a young project maintained mainly by [Andrew R. McCluskey](https://github.com/arm61) and we're excited to have you join!
Most of our discussions will take place on open [issues](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/intro_python_chemists/issues).

As a reminder, we expect all contributors to this book to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/intro_python_chemists/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in these conversations.

## Contributing through GitHub

[git](https://git-scm.com) is a really useful tool for version control.
[GitHub](https://github.com) sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

You'll use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to chat in issues and pull requests on GitHub.
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with formatting.
For example you could write words as bold (`**bold**`) or in italics (`*italics*`)

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

## Understanding issues, milestones and project boards

Every project on GitHub uses [issues](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/intro_python_chemists/issues) slightly differently.

The following outlines how the `intro_python_chemists` developers think about these tools.

**Issues** are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forwards.
A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that
is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.

## Recognizing contributors

We welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development.
You can see a list of current contributors in the [contributors tab][https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/intro_python_chemists/graphs/contributors].

## Thank you!

You're awesome.
