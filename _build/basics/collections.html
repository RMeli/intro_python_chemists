<p>Previously, we were introduced to individual types that exist in Python. 
Python types go beyond individual items, including objects that can hold <strong>collections</strong> of variables. 
This section will introduce three different collection types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Dictionarys</li>
</ul>
<p>As is the case with individual types, different collection types can be acted on in different ways.</p>
