<p>This textbook is designed to be interactive, there will be code for you to run and places where you will be asked to write your own code.
The interactivity is achieved through the use of <a href="http://mybinder.org">mybinder.org</a>, <a href="https://github.com/minrk/thebelab">Thebelab</a>, or downloading the notebook and running it locally, at the top of any page that contains interactive content, there will be the following three buttons.</p>
<p><img src="./images/thebebinder.png" alt="The Thebelab and mybinder Interact buttons"></p>
<ul>
<li>The first button will offer file formats to download the page as a .ipynb file which can be run locally,</li>
<li>The "Interact" button will open a Jupyter Notebook version of the page running on the mybinder resources in a new tab, and </li>
<li>The "Thebelab" button will make the code blocks in the webpage interactive, such that they can be run, edited and rerun.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Interact and Thebelab buttons will run on the <strong>free</strong> mybinder resource.
It may take some time to build this resource, so please be pacient.</p>
